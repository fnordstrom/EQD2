# Usage

This is a write-enabled script that calculates the corresponding EQD2 distribution from an absorbed dose distribution. Make sure to select 'Absolute dose' when analyzing the EQD2 distribution.

If the script is used in a clinical environment, make sure to read and follow the instructions in the Varian `Eclipse Scripting API Reference Guide` for Script Approval, which can be downloaded from [MyVarian.com](http://www.myvarian.com).
